									Website Automation using UIPath
								</p>
							</header>
							<p>This project was professional in nature. A fellow coworker and I were tasked with transferring the Video and Caption Data from One Media Hosting service to another. </p>
                            <p>
                                Due to this project being a onetime operation with a timeline, we designed our automation system to be minimal and adaptable, as the primary reason for automating this process in the first place was saving time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After determining the number of steps required to fully complete a transfer by completing several manually, my coworker and I determined that automation was necessary as each transfer required close to a hundred steps between all the various stages of transfer, and with eighty-seven hundred transfers needing completion manual transferring was not feasible with just the two of us dedicated to this project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Due to the nature of the multiple stages of the transfer process my coworker and I opted to not create a single automation process but instead break it up into several independent programs to make troubleshooting easier as the goal was to minimize time as much as possible. </p>

						      	</header>
								<p>I Created this Portfolio website my using by writing the HTML and CSS needed for this website as well as using a free JavaScript template to handle the animations and responsive elements of the website. </p>
                                <p>This project helped me to expand my knowledge of Web development using HTML and CSS and well as challenged my computer science skills. </p>
                                <p>
                                    The HTML and CSS code for this website were written 
                                    by me using a combination of Visual Studios Code and Adobe Dreamweaver, 
                                    with the website itself being hosted on GitHub. 
                                    While I did use some free open-source templates to aid me the majority of the programming was done by me.

									<h2>About</h2>
									<header>
									  <p>My background and interests</p>
								    </header>
</header>
<p>
	I was Born in the Bay area but have spent most of my life living in the foothills of the greater Sacramento area. My biggest interests include Music, Computers/ electronics, and Art. I have always been interested in music, having messed around with my father's guitars when I was little, I played the saxophone in my school band through both middle and high school as well as preformed with several ensembles on the side throughout the years where I picked up experience in percussion and a little in piano. I have continued my Music interests since graduating by continuing to play the saxophone in ensembles when time allows and by picking up the guitar in a casual setting. As for Computers I have always had a fascination around computers and electronics in general, from building computers and servers with my father as a child, to taking mechatronics and computer programming courses in high school, to majoring in Computer engineering in college, as well as working on several electronics projects as a hobby and working in the IT field. As for art like music I have always been interested in creative outlets although I admit I have very little skill when it comes to art, though I have had a modicum of success with design. </p>

		  <p>My Education and Skills</p>
	  </header>
		<p>
			I am currently enrolled in Sacramento State as a Computer Engineering major, though I am looking at having to take a break from college due to life circumstances. I have taken many programing and computer logic courses as well as an electronic logic design course in college. While not as impressive, in high-school I took several related courses including mechatronics, computer programming, and statistics.
		</p>

		  <p>Work Experience</p>
		</header>
	<p>My first official job was an unpaid Volunteer position with my High Schools IT department, this position required me to resolve teacher requests received either via phone or our schools ticketing system, preform maintenance on various pieces of school technology, as well repair or replace broken components on both Desktop Computers and school issue Chromebooks. This position made me learn a broad range of skills and knowledge to handle the day-to-day technology requirements of the school.
	  <br/>
	  My second job and a position I am still in, is working customer service for SacAnime, a seasonal convention event. There are usually three or four conventions held a year, each convention is a weekend event in which I usually clock fifty to seventy hours. This position requires me to engage with customers to help them either buy or redeem their Event passes, as well as answering any questions about the event they may have, and in the case of an issue or complaint being brought to be handling the situation if it is within my power or escalating it to the proper department head if not. This position has me improve my customer service skills as well as my ability to interact with customers in a professional manner and remain calm in stressful or heated situations.
	  <br/>
		My most recent Position working in IT support at Sacramento state was similar to my first job in many respects, with the most noticeable difference being the size of the operations, At my High school my department of 5 managed around 100 classrooms all of which were only equipped with a single simple technology setup, meanwhile at Sacramento State my department of 10 is in charge of managing nearly 400 classrooms equipped with one of 5 different AV setups, each setups consisting of at least 10 devices as opposed to the 3 or 4 of my high schools setups. This position really helped me adjust to the difficulties of being part of a large organization and all that entails, such as working with different departments, and managing a far greater range of equipment.
